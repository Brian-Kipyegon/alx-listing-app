# ALX Listing App

## Project Description

ALX Listing App is a property listing application inspired by Airbnb. It displays various properties with images, descriptions, and action buttons like "Book Now" and "Details". The goal is to build a clean, reusable component-based React/Next.js app that can be expanded for full booking functionality.

## Project Structure

- `components/`: Contains reusable React components such as `Card` and `Button`.
- `interfaces/`: TypeScript interfaces defining props and data structures for components.
- `constants/`: Contains reusable constants like API URLs and UI text.
- `public/assets/`: Holds images, SVGs, and other static assets used across the app.
- `pages/`: Contains Next.js page components, including the main `index.tsx` landing page.
